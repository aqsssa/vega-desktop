#### Features

- Can read both vega and vega-lite files.
- Save output as `svg` or `png` from UI.
- Can determine the file format if the extension is `*.vg.json` or `*.vl.json`.
- If the extension is just `*.json`, will check for `$schema` field in the JSON spec.
- Otherwise will try to parse as vega-lite, then vega.
- It will load external data files relative to the spec files directory.

You also can set your OS to have `*.vg.json` or `*.vl.json` opened with vega-desktop by default.
